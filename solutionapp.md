This project provides an AI-powered prototype that connects idea documentation from GitHub, generates functional outputs through AI prompts, and deploys the results on Vercel for hosting. The workflow is simplified by syncing files to Supercloud for easy access, customizing UI templates in Figma, and refining the final prototype in Wix Studio. This end-to-end process ensures that ideas are quickly transformed into interactive, visually appealing, and functional software prototypes.
